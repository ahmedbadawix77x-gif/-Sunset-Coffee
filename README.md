# ☕ Sunset Coffee — Premium Multi-Page Café Website

A complete, beautifully crafted website for **Sunset Coffee** — a fictional café that blends warmth, elegance, and modern web design. Built with **pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, this project showcases professional-grade front-end development with full **Arabic (RTL) support**, cinematic animations, and a cohesive visual language.

## 🌟 Highlights

### 🎨 Design & UX
- **Fully RTL-optimized**: Designed from the ground up for Arabic, with `dir="rtl"`, logical layout flow, and right-aligned navigation.
- **Glassmorphism Navbar**: A sticky header with frosted-glass effect (`backdrop-filter: blur()`) that stays elegant while scrolling.
- **Dynamic Shine Animations**: Headings and logo feature a luminous "shine" effect using animated gradients and `background-clip: text`.
- **Warm, Cohesive Theme**: Coffee-inspired palette (browns, beiges, golds) managed via **CSS custom properties** for easy theming.
- **Custom Typography**: Arabic fonts *"Cairo"* and *"Tajawal"* from Google Fonts for refined readability.

### 🧩 Architecture
- **3-Page Structure**:
  - `index.html` — Home (hero, about, featured items, testimonials, contact)
  - `menu.html` — Full café menu with categorized items
  - `gallery.html` — Responsive image grid
- **Semantic HTML** & **Modular CSS**: Clean, reusable, and well-commented codebase.
- **Lazy-Loaded Images**: All `<img>` tags use `loading="lazy"` for faster initial load.

### ⚡ Interactivity (Vanilla JS)
- **Mobile Navigation**: Hamburger toggle for responsive menu on small screens.
- **Scroll-Triggered Animations**:
  - Sections fade in with a subtle upward slide as they enter the viewport.
  - Menu cards animate individually for a refined reveal effect.
- **“Back to Top” Button**: Smooth-scroll button appears after 300px of scrolling.
- **Custom Lightbox Gallery**: Click any image → full-screen overlay with close-on-click. Built **without external libraries**.
- **Form Feedback**: Contact form prevents default submission and shows a user-friendly alert.

### 📱 Fully Responsive
- Fluid layouts using **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**.
- Mobile-first breakpoints with `@media` queries.
- Touch-friendly interactions on all devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** (semantic structure, RTL-ready)
- **CSS3** (Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties, `backdrop-filter`, `clip-path`, transitions)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** (DOM manipulation, scroll logic, Intersection Observer alternative, event handling)
- **Google Fonts** (`Cairo`, `Tajawal`)
